title: Filter bubbles and affective polarization in user-personalized large language
  model outputs
abstract: 'As cloud computing becomes pervasive, deep learning models are deployed
  on cloud servers and then provided as APIs to end users. However, black-box adversarial
  attacks can fool image classification models without access to model structure and
  weights. Recent studies have reported attack success rates of over 95% with fewer
  than 1,000 queries. Then the question arises: whether black-box attacks have become
  a real threat against cloud APIs? To shed some light on this, our research indicates
  that black-box attacks are not as effective against cloud APIs as proposed in research
  papers due to several common mistakes that overestimate the efficiency of black-box
  attacks. To avoid similar mistakes, we conduct black-box attacks directly on cloud
  APIs rather than local models.'
