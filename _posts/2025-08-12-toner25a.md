title: Performance of Zero-Shot Time Series Foundation Models on Cloud Data
abstract: Time series foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a popular paradigm for
  zero-shot multi-domain forecasting. FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets
  and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains,
  including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness
  of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful
  or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically,
  showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also
  illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly
  output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread
  failure of FMs to model cloud data.
