title: Modeling speech emotion with label variance and analyzing performance across
  speakers and unseen acoustic conditions
abstract: Spontaneous speech emotion data usually contain perceptual grades where
  graders assign emotion score after listening to the speech files. Such perceptual
  grades introduce uncertainty in labels due to grader opinion variation. Grader variation
  is addressed by using consensus grades as groundtruth, where the emotion with the
  highest vote is selected. Consensus grades fail to consider ambiguous instances
  where a speech sample may contain multiple emotions, as captured through grader
  opinion uncertainty. We demonstrate that using the probability density function
  of the emotion grades as targets instead of the commonly used consensus grades,
  provide better performance on benchmark evaluation sets compared to results reported
  in the literature. We show that a saliency driven foundation model (FM) representation
  selection helps to train a state-of-the-art speech emotion model for both dimensional
  and categorical emotion recognition. Comparing representations obtained from different
  FMs, we observed that focusing on overall test-set performance can be deceiving,
  as it fails to reveal the models generalization capacity across speakers and gender.
  We demonstrate that performance evaluation across multiple test-sets and performance
  analysis across gender and speakers are useful in assessing usefulness of emotion
  models. Finally, we demonstrate that label uncertainty and data-skew pose a challenge
  to model evaluation, where instead of using the best hypothesis, it is useful to
  consider the 2- or 3-best hypotheses.
