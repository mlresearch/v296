title: On the Power of Heuristics in Temporal Graphs
abstract: Dynamic graph datasets often exhibit strong temporal patterns, such as recency,
  which prioritizes recent interactions, and popularity, which favors frequently occurring
  nodes. We demonstrate that simple heuristics leveraging only these patterns can
  perform on par or outperform state-of-the-art neural network models under standard
  evaluation protocols. To further explore these dynamics, we introduce metrics that
  quantify the impact of recency and popularity across datasets. Our experiments on
  BenchTemp and the Temporal Graph Benchmark show that our approaches achieve state-of-the-art
  performance across all datasets in the latter and secure top ranks on multiple datasets
  in the former. These results emphasize the importance of refined evaluation schemes
  to enable fair comparisons and promote the development of more robust temporal graph
  models. Additionally, they reveal that current deep learning methods often struggle
  to capture the key patterns underlying predictions in real-world temporal graphs.
  For reproducibility, we have made our code publicly available.
