title: Rethinking Evaluation for Temporal Link Prediction through Counterfactual Analysis
abstract: 'In response to critiques of existing evaluation methods for temporal link
  prediction (TLP) models, we propose a novel approach to verify if these models truly
  capture temporal patterns in the data. Our method involves a sanity check formulated
  as a counterfactual question: “What if a TLP model is tested on a temporally distorted
  version of the data instead of the real data?” Ideally, a TLP model that effectively
  learns temporal patterns should perform worse on temporally distorted data compared
  to real data. We analyse this hypothesis and introduce two temporal distortion techniques
  to assess six well-known TLP models.'
