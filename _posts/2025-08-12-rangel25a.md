title: On the Limits of Applying Graph Transformers for Brain Connectome Classification
abstract: Brain connectomes offer detailed maps of neural connections within the brain.
  Recent studies have proposed novel connectome graph datasets and attempted to improve
  connectome classification by using graph deep learning. With recent advances demonstrating
  transformers’ ability to model intricate relationships and outperform in various
  domains, this work explores their performance on the novel NeuroGraph benchmark
  datasets and synthetic variants derived from probabilistically removing edges to
  simulate noisy data. Our findings suggest that graph transformers offer no major
  advantage over traditional GNNs on this dataset. Furthermore, both traditional and
  transformer GNN models maintain accuracy even with all edges removed, suggesting
  that the dataset’s graph structures may not significantly impact predictions. We
  propose further assessing NeuroGraph as a brain connectome benchmark, emphasizing
  the need for well-curated datasets and improved preprocessing strategies to obtain
  meaningful edge connections.
