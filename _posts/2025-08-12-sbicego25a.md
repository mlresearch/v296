title: On the Role of Structure in Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks
abstract: 'Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) integrate pooling layers to generate
  graph representations by progressively coarsening graphs. These GNNs are provably
  more expressive than traditional GNNs that solely rely on message passing. While
  prior work shows that hierarchical architectures do not exhibit empirical performance
  gains, these findings are based on small datasets where structure-unaware baselines
  often perform well, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we comprehensively
  investigate the role of graph structure in pooling-based GNNs. Our analysis includes:
  (1) reproducing previous studies on larger, more diverse datasets, (2) assessing
  the robustness of different architectures to structural perturbations of the graphs
  at varying depths of the network layers, and (3) comparing against structure-agnostic
  baselines. Our results confirm previous findings and demonstrate that they hold
  across newly tested datasets, even when graph structure is meaningful for the task.
  Interestingly, we observe that hierarchical GNNs exhibit improved performance recovery
  to structural perturbations compared to their flat counterparts. These findings
  highlight both the potential and limitations of pooling-based GNNs, motivating the
  need for more structure-sensitive benchmarks and evaluation frameworks.'
