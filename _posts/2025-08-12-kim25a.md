title: An Integrated YOLO and VLM System for Fire Detection in Enclosed Environments
abstract: While YOLO models show promise in car fire detection, they remain insufficient
  for real-world deployment in confined parking environments due to dataset limitations,
  evaluation gaps, and deployment constraints. We first fine-tune YOLO on a fire/smoke-augmented
  dataset, but analysis reveals its struggles with ambiguous fire-smoke boundaries,
  leading to false predictions. To address this, we propose a real-time end-to-end
  framework integrating YOLOv8s with Florence2 VLM, combining object detection with
  contextual reasoning. While YOLOv8s with VLM improves detection reliability, challenges
  are still ongoing. Our findings highlight YOLOâ€™s limitations in fire detection and
  the need for a more adaptive, environment-aware approach.
