title: Challenges of Decomposing Tools in Surgical Scenes Through Disentangling The
  Latent Representations
abstract: Image generation through disentangling object representations is a critical
  area of research with significant potential. Disentanglement involves separating
  the representation of objects and their attributes, enabling greater control over
  the generated output. However, existing approaches are limited to disentangling
  only the objectsâ€™ attributes and generating images with selected combinations of
  attributes. This study explores learning object-level disentanglement of semantically
  rich latent representation using von-Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. The proposed
  approach aims to disentangle compressed representations into object and background
  classes. The approach is tested on surgical scenes for disentanglement of tools
  and background information using the Cholec80 dataset. Achieving tool-background
  disentanglement provides an opportunity to generate rare and custom surgical scenes.
  However, the proposed method learns to disentangle representations based on pixel
  intensities. This study uncovers the challenges and shortfalls in achieving object-level
  disentanglement of the compressed representations using vMF distributions. The code
  for this study is available at https://github.com/it-is-lokesh/vMF-disentanglement-challenges.
